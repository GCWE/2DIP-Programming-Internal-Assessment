# üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è 2DIP Programming Internal Assessment - GPMe üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

## Brief
A program for diagnosing simple illnesses, through a Feed Forward Neural Network - this makes use of probability to determine the accuracy of the produced result.

Each of the above folders contains individual iterations of the program - the first two are text-based, while the final three are GUI-based (constructed using Tkinter and Figma).

I have chosen to add the datafile only to Versions 1 and 2 of the program - this is because Versions 3, 4 and 5 all have integrated tools for creating the file if it isn't present. I have thus intentionally removed them to exhibit the development in the program, as well as to provide the user with further confidence that the program is working.


## Requirements

Below are the contents of the requirements.txt file:
```
halo==0.0.31
nltk==3.8.1
numpy==1.24.3
torch==2.0.1
```

Be sure to import these modules/libraries before running the program.
```
$ pip install halo nltk numpy torch
```

Additionally, you'll need to run the following in the terminal (or uncomment line 8 in nltk_utils.py):
```
$ python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
```

This downloads the "bare bones" model through which the neural network can be built on my own data.

### Note:
GPMe does not at all intend to replace traditional diagnosis methods - it does, however, aim to provide users particularly with low access to medical services to get a simple diagnosis without the fear for time or money.

The hope is that one day GPMe will transcend to assist the medical field where finance hits hardest.
